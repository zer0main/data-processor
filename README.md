# data-processor
It's a small script for the processing of experimental data.
The main idea is to compare experimental and theoretical
(calculated by the formula) data.
Theoretical data consists of "wrong" (calculated by the
wrong formula that doesn't consider work of friction forces
in the curved track section) and correct data.

See [the article][formula] about deducing of the used
formula (only in Russian).
